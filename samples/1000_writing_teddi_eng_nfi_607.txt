Explain to me, why are we trusting Manni Attah?Sick bastard.It's 50-50 for conspiracy to supply to stick.Somebody told you to do this.And I promise you, they are laughing.Now is the time to tell everything.- Roland Berry.Manni asked me to adjust his record.Roland Berry, 14, lived at Forest Walk care home.That was no overdose.That was Manni.Cut your lights.Shit!I don't know what happened, ma'am.I cut the engine, the steering died.Well, it would, you dick!I said cut the lights.Come on!I'm trying to do this without giving your neighbours something to laugh at.Warrant to search your premises for evidence leading to the corruption and death of Sergeant Ewan Murray.Don't be a fool.No... him.Let the search commence.Beg pardon, scuse fingers.- Cover up, Nora.Emmanuel Attah, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder and the corruption of a member of public office.What's that?Toasted SIM cards.You've got something to hide, Manni?Except for a private life that's far too sweet for have-nots.What ar
e they talking about?Questions, Nora.Let's go.Thanks for the pork you left us.We barbecued the night away, didn't we, Spike?We have a confession connecting you with the corruption of Ewan Murray.Then you've all you need.File the charges, mate.- He's dead.Murdered.Oh.Forensics reported a cocktail of warfarin and caustic soda in the heroin that you supplied him.- Ma'am.Don't invite them in.He's not stopping.Tell them to tell him, "Passport's frozen."If we never get him back in this building, mightn't we regret letting him go?Asking upfront who and where is Roland Berry, we might never find out.Too fast, we're gonna be signing the kid's death warrant.If he exists.Right, that's it, is it?Covered all Sergeant Murray's likely crooks and fannies?Yep, it's a very small premises.Prem... premise.What, are you taking the piss, or what?Right, since when does a divorcee spend money on plants?It's plastic.Yeah, and who works in a shithole this size and shares it... with a plant stand?Yeah!And we're 
certain he was straight, eh?Oh.Oh.Ooh!Oooh.Yeah, but, rumour has it that things never got that far, so don't milk it and just thank yourself that you were ever so cautious.Once again, don't forget to bag up, kids.- These USBs.All these can be currently accounted for by carers or social workers.Of these, well, five died in the Vapour Nest fire.Haley's gone back to her own family...And Kim Garvey as we know is in youth custody.Look, I've been going back over his social network trying to connect him to this Roland Berry.We found this file in Murray's flat.He's actually Peter Roland Berry and... .. here's what he looks like.Yeah, he went by Roland after his parents abandoned him.Ewan's final entry in all the station files said that Roland was fostered by a family in west Yorkshire.Well, according to child services, that never happened.Forest Walk care home reported Roland missing four weeks ago.It's a recurring pattern with these kids.And Ewan never logged the call.Ma'am.DCI Lickberg asked
 me to make you personally aware of this.Joy, Daffodil sent it, it's all kicking off.Someone's obstructed the women going into the procedures.Which lot?No idea.- Er, Tegan, do you just wanna...The report on this morning's raid at Nora's.The lab are rushing through the DNA results like a launderette, but these are some early prints we found all over Nora's kitchen that you... need to see.And I'd watch where you're pointing that, if I were you.Nora's gaffe is riddled with Donna Calvert's dabs.Stuart, you recall Sergeant Freers.Like, now!Diana.The last person I should be sending to The Daffodil Centre is Joy.Officer of the police wades into abortion debate with own opinions.Well, like, I don't have them too?Yes, but you're aggro.She's judgment.Just sort it for me, will you, love?What?What kind of name is Daffodil for an abortion clinic?He made it sound like the Moss Side riots.I know!Hiya.Yeah, that were me.We all have procedures booked.I were first on the list, but they've all downed too
ls.So, you're on strike?All we ask is an agreement to discuss wages without being screamed at.- This is a peaceful protest.Doctor Vicks, I own the practice with my husband.This is an illegal pay dispute brutally timed to hit a surgical day.She pays me 20,000 a year.A lot of us make good off 20,000 a year.I'm a surgeon.That's not legal.And locking up Robert is?They have my husband as a hostage.- Erm, hostage?I want these people out of my building.So why don't you just sack us, Rosa?And she won't free us to leave without charging our next employer a quit visa.All you had to do was read the contract.Tegan, call it in.Peaceful protest, no need for backup.I've one week left before losing the choice.If I have to take another three days off work,I won't have a job to go back to.Diana.Ah!Please, show them through.Ladies, thank you so much for your patience.They will have surgery up and running within 45 minutes.They are now officially obstructing clinical practice.Over to you.OK.Where's this o
ther doctor?Which one of these is this?Any murky treasures, my boys?This USB has saved us a shitload in warrants.It's all Ewan's phone bills.Can we not refer to him as Sergeant Murray or Ewan?It's just Murray, OK?Fair point.Second account's full of Manni Attah... apart from pizzas.How's that a smackhead?Might be small, but I'd put money on this being vital.Morning, all, rise and shine.Please put all evidence from Sergeant Murray's office and flat on this table here for these officers to box and remove.- Excuse me, ma'am.The suspicious death of an officer warrants a full scene investigation team.Well, this is no longer about Sergeant Murray, this is about Manni Attah.- These are leads we can't do without.If we get another chance to put Nora and Manni Attah on trial, we will not fail on a technicality, do you understand?Good morning, Professor.And if "while you're down there, ma'am" comes out of that mouth, this'll be the last expression you ever see.Oh.Here you are, lads, one for the bo
x.What did you have to give her?Just a fountain pen, and it leaks like fuck.Right, to get into that, you'll need to sync it with a C drive copy you didn't thieve from Ewan's office.I need it sharpish.I'm not touching that till you've cleaned it, you tramp.Where's the key?- Is that you, Rosa?Oh, Christ.I'm afraid I'm not decent.We all picked a bad day, but the show's over now, folks.You debagged your boss?How's that going to hike up your wages?Because they won't listen otherwise.Well, listen to us... you either get us the key...- Or what?- I'm getting very hot in here.What?- Get the key.Secure the entrance.Rob!Bob!Come on!Something's wrong.Come on, come on.Come on.Oh, Robert.Oh, my God.Get him over.He's not breathing.Right, there you go.A lesser man would have stolen your thunder, but I'll leave you to it, so go to his deleteds, look at the MPEG file, go straight to 3 minutes 20.Enjoy.Oh, you're welcome!Er, ma'am.Ma'am.This is Roland Berry.Interviewed by Murray.'Of course I got hurt.'Bu
t what do I say at AE?'I'm not doing it again.'I'm not going through that again.- 'And where did Manni take you?'Some Game of Thrones looking dive with...'I was unconscious when I went in and when I came round,'I was in this weird room.'All he smelt of was Chinese food.'He raped me.'Manni had to abuse the kids himself.Lads?Is this something we've heard before because I haven't?He keeps his secrets well.But do we reckon that Nora knows about this or not?Who says she does?Who reckons she's in the dark?Yeah.This is proof, right?- We can nail him.It's a child, not a solid object.What I mean is, Nora's lawyers could and would tear that apart in a heartbeat.Joy's right.The only tangible connection we've got is Kim Garvey.Who just got transferred to Hilltop Bounds youth custody for bad behaviour.We need a gauge on how much Kim Garvey knows.Are you happy to go to Hilltop?Yeah, of course.Why wouldn't I be?- Pads on.Stand clear.Shocking now.Stand clear.Shocking.Shocking now.Time of death... 12.0
1pm.I'm so sorry, Rosa.Oh, shut up!Just shut up, you fucking...I have a job to finish.Rosa, you're in shock, you shouldn't...I made this woman a promise.Don't take this personal, but the guy died waiting.Er, Tegan.What's this?Oi!No, we can park where we want.And we couldn't agree more.- Yeah?There's been a death in there.Yeah, there's been dozens.Abortion is murder!Oh, for God's sake!Yeah...You've buffed up a bit.I'm...What, by the Attahs?Oi, how rude's that?By the Government.And how well do you think Roland Berry is being cared for right now?Er, that's not a name I know.Who do you think that is?Lowely Downs children's home.Took me a long time to learn how to speak and look like this, but I won't forget to think like you, so don't fuck me about.Where's Roland Berry?I got fostered, sent to Leeds.Not Leeds...Did Manni tell you to repeat that?No, but Roly sent us messages when he first got a family.Whatever you've seen online don't count as him.He hasn't been seen in person since five day
s before his last entry.Why is that?I interviewed you alongside Sergeant Ewan Murray.Have you met him before?I don't think so.That's funny, he's been on your child protection team twice.- Still no?Who's Roland talking to here?'He raped me.'I just want moving out.So, this isn't you?In the same room?Right there?Still no?Well, that officer's dead because he got heroin from Manni Attah.It was contaminated, deliberately.Now, if I kept telling lies, the way you keep having to,I'd be seriously worried about my own personal safety.Kim, you both went to see Sergeant Murray for help in being relocated.Thought was the bravest thing you ever could do and he sold you both down the river.- Visit's over.You fuck!Fuck you, man!Fuck you!Get the fuck off me!- Calm down!I'm only standing on this side because I learnt to fix things.You, and all the people Manni Attah is exploiting...Are you aware that none of you had criminal records, not one?Think about it.If you know where Roland Berry is, please... ..
