'I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.Our ancestors took this land and you will die for it, if needed.'I saw m
y father killed in battle and my uncle steal his lands.'I was taken by the invaders - 'first as a sl

in the North.'In the year 878 at Ethandune,'I fought alongside King Alfred 'to defeat the Danes, and
 drove them from Wessex, 'but at a great price.'Uhtred Ragnarson, I have a gift for you.Your queen!'
Peace was secured with hostages, Brida and Ragnar, 'and by the Danish earl's baptism and acceptance

 Trew.Lord, I am honoured.Brother Trew has travelled from the North.Cumbraland, in the west of North
umbria.He has a letter that tells of a vision and a prophecy.From the heavens, Lord, I swear.The Abb
ot Eadred of Cumbraland did dream of the likeness and this likeness did speak to him.The likeness wa
s of Saint Cuthbert.Cuthbert?Speaking directly from heaven.The Abbot tells of Cuthbert's instruction
 within the letter.Lord, for the Saxons and Britons in the North, there is an urgency.We are lost, w
e are, in general, ruled by Danes, we are in need of a Christian saviour.This saviour is Guthred.A m
an who is a lowly slave and who himself must first be saved.At the behest of the blessed Cuthbert.Th
e doors are open to the elements, Brother Trew, nothing more.It can be done, Lord, it can be arrange

arseling!If you're drinking to forget Iseult, you do her no favours.Her memory should be cherished, 
not lost in a fog of ale and bosoms.My sword.Are we to ride to Northumbria, or to the next inn and t
he next jug of ale?What am I to do in Northumbria with an army of two, a nun and a rag-arse?A loyal 
rag-arse.Prepare yourself.To do what?You can begin to carry yourself as a Lord!Or we can return to W
inchester?Did she not say that your path led North?Thank you.YORK KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIAForgive me, 
Lord.Please, Lord.May the gods protect you on your quest.What do you know of my gods?Nothing, Lord.S
igefrid, leave him, he's just a priest.Come on, brother, we have Scots to kill.Erik!The city, we lea
ve in your hands.It's ours, it must remain ours.I will ensure it.You have enough men, keep them sobe
r and do not kill for the fun of it.No, Lord.You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was goi

t awaits us!To the joy of battle!And to the blood of the Scots!Father Hrothweard, we've been waiting
 for you.I will serve.We must rise up.Every day we hear stories of what has happened in Wessex.The b
rothers have, this very moment, taken their army North.They will be gone for months, perhaps.There i
s no better time than now.We must take Alfred's lead and kill every bastard Dane and Northman in Eof
erwic... in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.I'm not saying grace!It is a battle 
cry!Smoke.Come on.Danes.Danes would not slaughter Danes like this.If there is slaughter, Lord, and t
here appears to be slaughter, why do we ride towards it?We are curious.Fight the Dane!Test your swor
d-craft!Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!You can cut him, but you cannot kill h
im!And if he kills you, then so be it!More fool you!Hit him!Hit him!Go on, hit him!Lord?Lord, we are
 Saxons, it's none of our business.If it is a fight you want, it can be with me.This is Lord Uhtred 
of Bebbanburg and of Wessex!It's sport, Lord, a pastime.Your sport is over.Pick up your sword.Pick i
t up.Lord, this man belongs to me.He's my prisoner.He was left in command.Is it Valhalla you want?In
 time, Lord.Freedom would be my first choice.Who do you serve?The brothers, Sigefrid and Erik.They'v

t a coin.A coin, Lord?No more word, I'm warning you!- Leave now.Go.You!State your name and your busi

 that of a priest.He's Uhtred of Bebbanburg, Father.Uhtred?You are "The" Uhtred?Who served with Alfr
ed at Ethandun?I am.Praise Him.Praise God!You know of Ethandun?Not only do we know of this battle, L
ord, we have risen because of it.And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.You killed a
ll the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?We have.All those that did not flee.The holy city of Eoferwic welco
mes you.We will give you food and shelter and thanks, Lord Uhtred.God bless you.We take care of the 
horses... and then I find Alfred's priest.We carry it all, we must.But what guarantee do we have tha
t he will not steal Alfred's silver?None.But that's the risk we have to take.Have you been stealing 
from Alfred, Father Beocca?Uhtred!My goodness, Uhtred!Wow!What a joy it is to see you!And for me to 
see your hairless head!I have been praying that our paths would cross.This is a sign, God's will.Bro
ther Trew, this is the man I've been speaking about.And here he is!We are travelling North with Alfr
ed's blessing and silver.It is a ransom to be paid to free a slave... but he is no ordinary slave.Th
is man is marked to become a king of Cumbraland.His name is Guthred.A Dane?But a good man, a man of 
God.The spirit of Saint Cuthbert has decreed that Guthred shall be King.A prophecy.My good lord.He a
ppeared in a dream to the Abbot Eadred of Cumbraland.He named Guthred as king of both Saxons and Dan
es.How many men is that?Hundreds, thousands, perhaps.- Warriors?Alfred would not be content with thi
s man being solely.King of Cumbraland.Well, yes, Alfred would wish for Guthred's influence to spread
 across the whole of Northumbria.Including here, in Eoferwic.Come with us.Help us to free Guthred, p
rotect the ransom until it is delivered, and I'm sure that we'll be rewarded.Your bargain is with wh
om?A slave master.The village in which we are meeting sits on land that belongs to someone from your
 past.Kjartan.Kjartan's land will be full of men, warriors.Father, who's protected you so far?Do you
 have no guard?We have gathered a group of sickly men, who suffer with the White Riff.Leprosy is a t
errible curse.Put these poor creatures in a cart and no man dare approach.No-one can imagine the tre
asure sitting beside the disease.Your king, Guthred...Kjartan would be his enemy?He would.Guthred hi
mself was captured and sold as a slave.Then he would be prepared to raise an army against Kjartan?He
 would be an ally, I'm sure.As I'm sure Uhtred is, but one man, against many...No, no, Uhtred is mor
e than just one man, and he is here for a reason.I have come to wish you goodnight, Lord.Rest well.S
tay.Stay.I have been thinking of Northumbria.Eoferwic is the great city of the North.To make it Saxo
n once again would bring hope.It would be a beacon.Yes.A fortress, from which all Danes of the North
 could be challenged... and England grows.Should you not be sleeping, Lord?Yes, I should be sleeping
.I've always intended to ask about the amber on the hilt of your sword.Is it decoration, or somethin
