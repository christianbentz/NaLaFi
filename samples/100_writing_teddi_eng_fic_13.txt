When one remembers that many of the watercourses here named would beconsidered large rivers outside 
of South America; that, notwithstandingtheir countless rapids and waterfalls, necessitating numberle
ssportages, Mme. Coudreau explored all these rivers from their embouchuresto as near their sources a
s the water would carry her rude dugouts, wecan form some idea of the miles she traveled and of the 
stupendous laborthat was involved in making these long journeys in the sweltering anddebilitating an
d insect-laden atmosphere of the Amazon basin.Pg 266As woman was the first nurse, so was she also th
e first practitioner ofthe healing art. Among savages the world over it is the women, in thegreat ma
jority of cases, who have the care of the sick and wounded, andwho, by reason of their superior know
ledge of simples for the cure ofdiseases, occupy the position of doctors. In certain parts of theunc
ivilized world there are, it is true, shamans or medicine men; butthese are conjurers or exorcists, 
who profess to expel disease, orrather the evil spirits causing the disease, by sorcery or incantati
on,rather than physicians who essay to cure ailments or relieve sufferingby the use of substances wh
ich experience has showed to possess remedialproperties. In a word, the shaman is a kind of a religi
ous functionarywho imposes on the ignorance of his tribe and who holds his position bythe fear he ex
cites, and not by any knowledge he possesses of thehealing art. It was the same, we may believe, in 
the early history ofour race—women, and not men, were the first physicians; and they werealso most p
robably the first surgeons.According to Greek mythology, the god of the medical art was Æsculapius,a
 male; but his six daughters, as antiquity beautifully expressed it,were not only goddesses but were
 also medical mistresses—artificesmedici—of suffering humanity. Of these Hygiea was speciallydisting
uished as the goddess of health, or, rather, as the conserver ofgood health, while Panacea was invok
ed as the restorer of health afterit had been impaired or lost.Pg 267One of the most beautiful pictu
res in the Iliad is that representing thedaughter of Augea, King of the Epei, caring for the wounded
 andsuffering Greeks on the plain before Troy. She was:Nothing deterred by the din of battle around 
her, she provided cordialpotions for the disabled warrior and preparedWhat a beautiful prototype of 
another ministering angel in the same landnearly thirty centuries later, amid similar scenes of suff
ering—of onewho, though unsung by immortal bard, the world will never let die—thecourageous, the sel
f-sacrificing Florence Nightingale.That there were in Greece from the earliest times numerous womenp
ossessed of a high degree of medical skill is evidenced by many of theancient writers. They were wha
t we would call medical herbalists, andnot a few of them exhibited a natural genius for determining 
thecurative virtues of rare plants and a remarkable sagacity in preparingfrom them juices, infusions
 and soothing anodynes. Others there werewho, in addition to evincing the cunning of leechcraft in t
hetherapeutic art, were distinguished for nimble hands in treating painfullesions and festering sore
s, and who, when occasion required, wereexperts in "quickly drawing the barb from the flesh and heal
ing thewound of the soldier."In the Odyssey special mention is made of the surpassing expertness oft
he Egyptian female leech, Polydamna, whose name signifies the subduerof many diseases. The land of t
he Nile, the poet tells us, "teems withdrugs," andIn this favored cradle of civilization, to which G
reece owed so much ofits knowledge and culture, there were many women who, like Polydamna,achieved d
istinction in the healing art, and many, too, we have reasonto think, who communicated their knowled
ge to their sisters in the fairland of Hellas.But not only were there in Greece women physicians lik
e Agamede, whowere noted for their general medicinal knowledge and practice, but therewere also othe
rs who made a specialty of treating ailments peculiar totheir own sex. This we learn from a passage 
in the Hippolytus ofEuripides, wherein the nurse of Phædra addressed the suffering queen inthe follo
wing words:More positive information, however, is afforded us by the ancient Romanauthor Hyginus, wh
o, in writing of the Greek maiden, Agnodice, tells ushow the medical profession was legalized for al
l the free-born women ofAthens. Instead of a literal translation of Hyginus, the version of hisstory
 is given in the quaint language of one Mrs. Celleor, a notedmidwife in the reign of James II."Among
 the subtile Athenians," writes Mrs. Celleor, "a law at one timeforbade women to study or practice m
edicine or physick on pain of death,which law continued some time, during which many women perished,
 both inchild-bearing and by private diseases, their modesty not permitting themto admit of men eith
er to deliver or cure them. But God finally stirredup the spirit of Agnodice, a noble maid, to pity 
the miserable conditionof her own sex, and hazard her life to help them; which, to enableherself to 
do, she apparelled her like a man and became the scholarPg 269 ofHierophilos, the most learned physi
cian of the time; and, having learntthe art, she found out a woman that had long languished under pr
ivatediseases, and made proffer of her service to cure her, which the sickperson refused, thinking h
er to be a man; but, when Agnodice discoveredthat she was a maid, the woman committed herself into h
er hands, whocured her perfectly; and after her many others, with the like skill andindustry, so tha
t in a short time she became the successful and belovedphysician of the whole sex."When it became kn
own that Agnodice was a woman "she was like to becondemned to death for transgressing the law—which,
 coming to the earsof the noble women, they ran before the Areopagites, and, the housebeing encompas
sed by most women of the city, the ladies entered beforethe judges and told them they would no longe
r account them for husbandsand friends, but for cruel enemies, that condemned her to death whorestor
ed to them their health, protesting they would all die with her ifshe were put to death. This caused
 the magistrates to disannul the lawand make another, which gave gentlewomen leave to study and prac
tice allparts of physick to their own sex, giving large stipends to those thatdid it well and carefu
lly. And there were many noble women who studiedthat practice and taught it publicly in their school
s as long as Athensflourished in learning."182After the time of Agnodice many Greek women won distin
ction in medicine,some as practitioners in the healing art, others as writers on medicalsubjects. No
r were their activities confined to the land of Hellas. Theywere also found succoring the infirm and
 instructing the poor andignorant in Italy, Egypt and Asia Minor. Among these was Theano, thewife of
 Pythagoras, who, after her husband's death, assumed charge ofhis school of philosophy,Pg 270 and wh
o, like her husband and teacher, wasdistinguished for her attainments in medicine. The names of many
 othersoccur in the pages of Hippocrates, Galen and Pliny; and frequentreferences are made to the wo
rks and prescriptions of women doctors whoenjoyed more than ordinary celebrity during their time. Of
 these femalepractitioners many confined their practice to the diseases of women andchildren, while 
others excelled in surgery and pharmacy, as well as ingeneral medical practice.Among the medical wom
en whom antiquity especially honored, particularlyduring the Greco-Roman period, were Origenia, Aspa
sia—not the famouswife of Pericles—and Cleopatra, who was not, however, as is oftenasserted, the ill
-fated queen of Egypt. Likewise deserving of specialmention was Metradora, of whom there is still pr
eserved in Florence amanuscript work on the diseases of women,183 and Antiochis, to whomher admiring
 countrymen erected a statue bearing the followinginscription: "Antiochis, daughter of Diodotos of T
los; the council andthe commune of the city of Tlos, in appreciation of her medical ability,erected 
at their own expense this statue in her honor."Pliny, the naturalist, felicitates the Romans on havi
ng been for nearlysix hundred years free from the brood of doctors. These he does nothesitate to ber
ate roundly. His statement regarding the non-existence ofphysicians, it must be observed, is somewha
t exaggerated. It is truethat during the first five centuries there were no professional doctorswho 
lived entirely on their practice. There were, however, many men whohad by long experience gained anP
g 271 extensive knowledge of drugs andsimples, and who were able to dress wounds and treat diseases 
withconsiderable success.The first Greek freeman to practice medicine in Rome was one Archagatos,abo
ut two centuries B.C. He was soon followed by one of his countrymennamed Asclepiades. These two soon
 built up a great reputation assuccessful practitioners, and were held in the highest esteem by thep
eople of Rome. In consequence of this and of the favorable conditionsoffered foreigners for the prac
tice of the healing art, there was soon alarge influx of physicians and surgeons from Greece, not on
ly into Romebut also into other parts of Italy.Not long after the arrival of Greek doctors in the ca
pital of the Romanworld we learn of certain women physicians in Rome who were held in highrepute. Am
ong these were Victoria and Leoparda, both mentioned by themedical writer, Theodorus Priscianus. To 
Victoria, Priscianus dedicatesthe third book of his Rerum Medicarum, and in the preface to this book
he refers to her as one who has not only an accurate knowledge ofmedicine, but also as one who is a 
keen observer and experiencedpractitioner.The word medica, which occurs in Latin authors of the clas
sicalperiod, testifies to the existence of the woman doctor as early as theage of Augustus.But the m
