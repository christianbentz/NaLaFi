those in life itself; it isPg 365impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their relation o
raffinity appear most to be twins, will upon comparison be found remarkablydistinct.” Beattie also h
ad commented on “that wonderfully penetrating andplastic faculty, which is capable of representing e
very species ofcharacter, not as our ordinary poets do, by a high shoulder, a wry mouth,or gigantic 
stature, but by hitting off, with a delicate hand, thedistinguishing feature, and that in such a man
ner as makes it easily knownfrom all others whatsoever, however similar to a superficial eye.” Quote
din Drake’s “Memorials of Shakespeare,” 1828, p. 255. Richard Cumberlandhad developed a parallel bet
ween Macbeth and Richard III in the Observer,Nos. 55-58, but it is to the suggestion of Thomas Whate
ley that Hazlitt ischiefly indebted. Both Richard III and Macbeth, says Whateley, “aresoldiers, both
 usurpers; both attain the throne by the same means, bytreason and murder; and both lose it too in t
he same manner, in battleagainst the person claiming it as lawful heir. Perfidy, violence, andtyrann
y are common to both; and these only, their obvious qualities, wouldhave been attributed indiscrimin
ately to both by an ordinary dramaticwriter. But Shakespeare, in conformity to the truth of history 
as far asit led him, and by improving upon the fables which have been blended withit, has ascribed o
pposite principles and motives to the same designs andactions, and various effects to the operation 
of the same events upondifferent tempers. Richard and Macbeth, as represented by him, agree innothin
g but their fortunes.” See the Variorum edition of “Richard III,”p. 549. Hazlitt makes similar discr

aracterof “Troilus and Cressida”: “He has no prejudice for or against hischaracters: he saw both sid
es of a question; at once an actor and aspectator in the scene.” Dr. Johnson had observed this attit
ude inShakespeare, but he had seen in it a violation of the demands of poeticjustice: “he carries hi
s persons indifferently through right and wrong,and at the close dismisses them without further care
, and leaves theirexamples to operate by chance. This fault the barbarity of his age cannotextenuate
; for it is always a writer’s duty to make the world better, andjustice is a virtue independent on t

ation of Lamb: “Among the distinguishingfeatures of that wonderful character, one of the most intere
sting yetpainful is that soreness of mind which makes him treat the intrusions ofPolonius with harsh
ness, and that asperity which he puts on in hisinterviews with Ophelia. These tokens of an unhinged 
mind if they be notmixed in the latter case with a profound artifice of love, to alienateOphelia by 
affected discourtesies, so to prepare her mind for the breakingoff of that loving intercourse, which
 can no longer find a place amidstbusiness so serious as that which he has to do are parts of hischa
racter, which to reconcile with our admiration of Hamlet, the mostpatient consideration of his situa
tion is no more than necessary; they arewhat we forgive afterwards, and explain by the whole of his 
character,but at the time they are harsh and unpleasant.... His behavior towardOphelia is not aliena
tion, it is a distraction purely, and so it alwaysmakes itself to be felt by that object: it is not 
anger, but griefassuming the appearance of anger,—love awkwardly counterfeiting hate, assweet counte
nances when they try to frown.” “On the Tragedies ofShakespeare.” Works, ed. Lucas, I, 103-104He may
