Previously on "once upon a time"...The evil queen sent everyone from the enchanted forest here.That's what you're going with?It's true.How long will you be with us?It's your destiny.You're gonna bring back the happy endings.I do hope you like apples.It's poison.You may not believe in the curse, but I believe in you.Henry!Every story in this book actually happened.Goodbye, Emma.Henry, you were right about the curse.I should've believed you.I love you, Henry.This might be the most important mission yet...Operation best man.Wake up.What is it, father?It's time.Don't be frightened.I'll stay behind, give you time to escape.No, I won't leave you.No, no.You have to make sure it stays safe.You have it, don't you?Of course.It never leaves my side.Good.It may be the realm's only hope of defeating the darkness.I will guard it with my life.It won't come to that.You need to get to safety.You need to share these stories.But who will believe them?Someday...Daddy!Don't worry about me.I...I know.Me too
.Go!The black fairy's curse!It's here!Where do you think it's taking us?Doesn't matter.Wherever we end up, we're gonna win.Archie!What happened?What did the black fairy's curse do?Really, Henry?Black fairy?Henry, I-i-i thought we were past all this.She's done something to you, to... to everyone.Henry, um...Do I need to schedule another appointment?Where is she?You know who.Henry...You know exactly where Emma is.She's in the same place that she's been for the last two years.Emma?You have a visitor.Your son.Mom.Henry.Thank god you remember me.Of course I remember you.Good, 'cause I just looked all over town, and I couldn't find the rest of our family...Snow, David, hook.No, no.I'm not going down that road again.I've worked way too hard for you to undo my progress.Progress?You know what I mean.Those people...Snow white, prince charming, captain hook...None of them are real.My parents are not fairy-tale characters.No one in storybrooke is.This is just a regular town.Mom...What happened to 
me is I'm getting better.I ended up in this nuthouse because I believed you back then, bought into all of it.No, this is the black fairy.She said she would take away your family, and this is how.She cursed you.I just...Want to get well so that maybe...Maybe I can be your mother.Okay.How long have you been a patient here?You know how long I've been here.Maybe it'll help if you relive it.Ever since you tried to prove that fairy tales were real by eating a poisoned apple turnover.You ended up in the hospital for weeks.You barely made it through.No, that's not how it happened.Don't you remember?My god.This is crazy.You're the one who's supposed to be getting better.Don't go back.Henry, you were not saved by a kiss.That's ridiculous.You were saved by medicine, by Dr. whale and by...It's time.Stop it.You can't take that.It might be how the black fairy is keeping you from remembering.Henry, just let me...Look.This page I wrote...It means that the final battle is coming.The key to winning it i
s in here.But we can't do that until you start believing.Sorry about him.You have to stop doing that, or your mother's not gonna let you keep visiting me.Regina.Who's Regina?Henry.There's my boy.Madame mayor, I'm sorry.I didn't know he was coming today.How many times have I told you?It's Fiona.No need for titles here.Now, Henry...Shouldn't you be at school?Of course.I just wanted to see my...What's that?Where did you find that?No.Nothing but trouble seems to come from this book.Now, Henry, back to school.I'll see you at dinner.Emma and I have some business to discuss.Okay, mom.Whatever she wants you to do, don't do it.Now then...I think somebody needs to take their medicine.David.Yeah, I'm okay.No.No.Emma?She's gone.The fairy...She ripped us apart.Ripped us apart?This is...What now?We're in the enchanted forest.Well, she has panache, I'll give her that.She took you from your wedding to theirs.This is where we got married.Right before we were cursed.Henry?Henry?Hey.We'll find him.If she
 thinks she can rip this family apart...Curses have never stopped us before.Today will be no different.We'll get Emma and Henry back.Wherever they may be.Hey, guys.All due respect, Emma, but you do seem quite agitated.Not at all.Yes, really.Everything is okay.Well, I just came to check on your progress.As mayor of storybrooke, can you blame me for taking a keen interest in all of our residents?All of your "troubled" residents.All due respect, Dr. hopper and madame mayor,I know exactly what this is really about.Do you now?Henry.Yes.Well, you are his biological mother, and he is my son, so perhaps there is a bit more to my interest.I don't think that's any secret.- I feel so loved.Emma has been doing quite well of late.Wonderful.Dr. hopper's reports are very encouraging.I don't think I'm talking out of school to say you might be eligible for release soon.Wouldn't it be nice to paint a different view than these dreary, old hospital grounds?We are working on the landscaping.Perhaps even th
e Boston skyline?As I recall, you had a lovely apartment overlooking it all.Wouldn't it be nice to go back?Yeah.Good.Because it's not just your well-being that I'm concerned with.It's Henry's.He's clearly still clinging to the delusion that these stories are real.Now, I'd hoped we were past all that.But now, thanks to you, I have a 14-year-old boy who still believed in fairy tales.Madame mayor, please.Sorry.I never meant to do any harm.Of course you didn't.But as luck would have it, his book has given me an idea of how we could cure him of all of this nonsense.What are you talking about?Burn it.Show him that you've truly embraced reality and then he will.Because belief in something, something that isn't real, can be dangerous.No.No?Look, I know all these stories are fake, but I can't destroy this.It means so much to Henry.Well, that's the point...And yours.I...I'm not ready for that.Really?You might not be ready now, but you will be.Of that, I am quite certain.Dr. hopper will hold onto
 it until that day comes.And it will...Because, miss swan... until you're ready to destroy the book and make a clean break from this fantasy world, you'll remain locked up.Emma!That bitch.Get her back.Which she is controlling.Why?It's the final battle.The final battle?Well, clearly, it wasn't what we thought it was.Clearly.Her soul.Of course the final battle isn't a war.It's a battle for her soul, for her belief, her hope.I don't get it.What does she gain if Emma stops believing?I think I might know.Zelena.What is she doing here?Helping, thank you very much.The mad hatter's hat.W-wasn't it destroyed?Well, he was a hatter.Inside are portals to every realm.I used it to escape oz.Escape?Why did you need to escape your own realm?Look, there isn't much time.It's easier if I show you.If you want to know what we were running from...Take a gander.There's nothing there.I can see that.When I left oz, it was falling apart...Apocalyptic, but now...It's erased.What the bloody hell does this got to 
do with Emma?This is what she's doing.It's why she wants Emma to destroy the book.As the savior's belief fades... so do all the realms of story.If we don't stop the black fairy... all the realms will be destroyed... and everyone in them.Who's here, papa?Just checking everything is as it should be.You know what they say...A mayor's work is never done.Madame mayor...An honor.I brought you lunch, and a little job if you'll take it.My wristwatch stopped.Guess I'm not good for timepieces.We'll figure out that clock tower one day.Don't worry.And I'll get working on the watch right away.Thank you.Thanks for lunch.Your favorite oatmeal raisin cookies are in there, too.Thank you.You're very kind, always thinking of Gideon.Well, when someone's lost their mother...I feel a need to step into that void.And how are you doing?I know this time of year can be difficult.Yes.It is hard, thinking of belle on our anniversary...Given what happened.Yes, it's terribly sad.So sad.Thank you.Well, I'll be back f
or the watch later.I always know I can count on you.And please...If there's anything I can do.After all, for my boys...I'm always here to help.I saw someone from arendelle just now.They still had snow on their shoulders.What?How far is this nightmare spreading?Far.Jasmine, Aladdin?It hit agrabah...We barely got our people out.The black fairy's doing this all the way from storybrooke.She's attacking Emma's belief.The more she loses faith, the realms of story fade away.We need to get back there and stop all this.What about the portal we just came through, the hat?It can't make a passage to a land without magic.We need something else.I have it.I mean, I think I have it.I might have a theory where to look.We don't need theories.Well, all due respect, captain, but what we need right now is magic.And that's my area.It's time I get to work and do what I do best.We need to get out of this hat and back to my castle.I don't care what kind of magic it takes,I'm getting Henry and Emma back.Henry?W
hat the hell?Dr. hopper really needs to keep an eye on his wallet.Come on.You serious?You don't belong here.And no matter what the mayor says, she's never letting you out.But I am.Welcome to operation cuckoo's nest.I haven't seen the movie in a long time, but didn't that end with a lobotomy?Just...We have to get out of here before the nurse comes back.Come on.Come on!Bloody hell.It's taller than I remembered.Hey!Next time you sneak off on a secret mission, you might want to make sure there's no munchkins around.They're easily bought.Honestly, stealth wasn't a priority...Speed was.So this is your theory on how to get home?Hoping there's a magic bean up there?There's only one way to find out.Hook, that beanstalk's over 1,000 feet high.You really think you can climb that alone?I think I want to get back to my wife.But making her a widow is not what I'd call a good plan.You're gonna get yourself killed.I'll have you know I've scaled this before.Really?With Emma.It was our first adventure t
