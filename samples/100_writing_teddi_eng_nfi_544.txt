Breaking out is just the beginning on prison break.Everything I did i did for family.Catch all-new e
pisodes Tuesdays, and check out our other fox programs--Legacy, Gotham and shots fired.The departmen
t is obviously corrupt.Only on fox.Previouslyonprisonbreak...Michael:Who the hell is the guy?He's my
 brother.Can't die on me now, Michael, you know, you're gonna tell me why I'm your whip hand.He's be
en busted up real bad.Jacob:It's not safe.Sara:Never thought I'd see this face again.Michael:Luca:Ho
w about you step out and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.There is nobility in you, Lincoln.We're gon
na need you.About the right things.Sara:It's him.Jacob isPoseidon.He'sa CIAoperative, deepcover.He t
argeted me for my skills.Michael, he's with our son right now.I'll get to the states as soon as I ca
n.Didmyhusband,Jacobness , ask you to work on my cell phone?He said he was looking to find thepeople
whowerestalking his wife, so I did a data dive.Where's my son?I have him.And whether or not i have t
o threaten him is entirely contingent upon you putting the gun down.Van gogh:They made you.Run!Whip:
Hey!Hey!Hey, yo, where we headed?Marseille.Whip:Jacob:I know everything about you.Even your most mun
dane actions, like the zoo.What's with you and the zoo?Michael:Jacob:Alotof thinking.Turns out he's 
not just a rebel leader-- he's a murderous sociopath.That's the only way to make omelets.I need to k
now more about our targets.If I'm facilitating escapes, we can't have surprises.Be proud.Don't act l
ike you're suddenly a fan of the status quo, okay?The system, it's slow, stupid, and doomed to fail.
That's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place.New ink since the last time I saw you
.Working on a new plan?Just get tired of looking at empty skin.Uh-huh.You know, it was those tats at
 fox river that caught my eye in the first place.I had to know everything about the man who wore his
 plans on his skin.In plain sight yet so mysterious.The key to real power is to disappear.Hi, profes
sor ness.Yeah, the secret to real power is to never betray your intentions, to wear nothing on your 
sleeve.And to never let anyone see your face.Come on in.Next time I'm sitting in solitary,I'll think
 of you in here, running the world in air-conditioned comfort.Jacob:You all set for Myanmar?It's onl
y a few weeks off.That's why I'm here.I want to bring someone on board.Oh, really?I've been watching
 this guy.Watching him?The last thing I was to do is suck someone else into this.He'll have my back 
and he'll speed things up, increase our odds.Not exactly a distinguished career.He's held up well in
 prison.And he grew up without a family.It means he can be manipulated.If you're planning something,
I'll always be a step ahead of you.You know that.I can see everything in your eyes.It's what's behin
d the eyes that counts, professor.Hmm.So you're gonna wait a year for me to find my way out of sittw
e?Or are you gonna get me a partner, so we get on with the business of changing the world?Done.I nee
d some food.I'm with you.Linc, it's Sara.She's back in New York.Lincoln:That's what I'm trying to fi
nd out.What is it, Michael?Something's wrong.Yes, you will.I got to get back to the states.You're ka
niel outis, remember?You're on every no-fly list in the world.Jacob's done something to Sara.How do 
you know?She referred to our son as junior.We agreed we'd never call him that.He's baiting you, Mich
ael.It worked.Hey, buddy.Where's mom?Oh.That is quite a pirate ship.Although it would be a little ha
rd to sail with the mast that far forward.Your ship might tip over.What do you mean?It's for Jimmy.I
 always find his.He doesn't always find mine.Wait a second, how is this drawing a map?This is the pa
rk.That's the playground.And this is the sidewalk.Impressive.You put a code in the drawing.So, okay,
 where did you hide the legos?These cannons are pools at the park.But there's an extra one, in the s
and.That's where I buried the legos.Well done, Mike.Well done.I've tried everyone.All my contacts.Li
nc, I got to get home.I can't spend another two weeks on a cargo ship.He's got my wife and kid.There
 may be another way.You told me about the last seven years of your life.Haven't told you about mine.
After Sara got exonerated, she left Panama.Me and Sofia stayed behind and opened a dive shop.We brok
e up, and everything went to hell.You weren't there to stop me, so before I knew it,I was in the old
 hood, doing odd jobs.Odd jobs meaning what?Moving things from point a to point b.For Luca abruzzi.J
ohn abruzzi's son.Yeah.I just wanted some quick cash to kick-start my life.They told me not to look 
in the boxes.But I looked in the boxes.The amount of fentanyl they're smuggling out of Europe-- tens
 of thousands of pills in every box-- it's just killing people.So I dumped a box in a dumpster, 100 
grand's worth.Now you're in hock to abruzzi's son.Yeah.But maybe it's a way to get back to the state
s real fast.Luca:You actually think i want to help you?What if I can get you the $100k?$100k?How are
 you gonna come up with that-- crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?I'm not in Chicago.Marseil
les?I've been working on a couple deals.Sureyoudo .That's why I'm calling.I need to sneak into the s
tates invisible, like your pills.Thoseflightsyougot comingoutof Europe-- the fentanyl flights-- i ne
ed a few seats.I'll tell you what.I'll make a few calls.'Cause either I'm gonna see you andgetthatmo
ney, orI 'mgonnaseeyou , andyou'regonnaget something awholelotworse.I can't believe I'm doing this t
o myself again.Difference is this time you're not alone.God, these things are disgusting.What they c
all 'em again?Boudinnoir.Not sure what's in them.I don't think your French is as good as you think i
t is.Yo, be happy you're not eating snails.Hey.Do you think they noticed?Let's not take any chances.
Guys.Your faces were on the news.Whip:We got to move, papi.Hold.If you can get to Lyon by midnight,I
 can get you on a flight.IgotawarehouseinNewYork.We'll be there.Can't decide whether I want you to h
ave that money or not, Burrows.Killingyoumightbe alotmoresatisfying.Jacob:Wecanbe prettysure he'scom
ingbacktoithaca.I need some clarification.Why would he come back here...To the states when he's more
 wanted here than anywhere else in the world?Of course.Because of them.He had a life before he worke
d for me, a name-A family.And when he went away, i ended up looking after them.Ended up... falling f
or them.Well...He wants to kill me.He thinks I stole his life, ruined him, which speaks to his disso
ciative mind.I mean, he's a murderer, a turncoat, a terrorist.But we'll use it.I'll be the bait if I
 have to.So we can go about taking him down once and for all.He's not just gonna stroll in here.He's
 too clever for that.That's why we got someone even more clever.Thoreau?Guy's a pencil neck.A pencil
 neck with insight into Scofield's plan.So you, in turn, can be the hammer.Nelson:He routed the imag
e through a server to this bluehawaii guy, but it could have been secretly subrouted to another, yet
 unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.Information?It's actually incredible.Encryp
ted in the arabic, the images are all sorts of stuff.Apparently, mundane as hell.Visiting hours for 
zoos, links to defunct message boards on the Internet.What message boards? both of which carry... th
is.Images of the Harlan gaines murder.What's the bastard doing rubbing that in our faces?Of all the 
things to encrypt, why that?What's that get you?Stegaonographically, a lot.Steganography is the prac
tice of concealing information in the code that makes up digital files.Russians do it, Chinese, ever
ybody.He's probably thinking if anyone sees this, this'll be as far as they'll look.But I'm already 
going inside the image, breaking down the data that comprises it.Point is we put big data, ai on thi
s, we can crunch any codes hidden in there pretty quickly.And that's what I'm doing.Nice work, but t
he truth is, if I've done my job, he may reveal his intentions to us first.Because I've got him so f
ar off his game now, he'llstart toplayhiscardstooearly ...Teddy."But in return, you must take a life
."Jacob: ...You have to call this pay phone in France.Wait.Not until you find out why you're my whip
-hand.I have to go to Chicago to find that out?Safe travels.In the grandiosity of his plan, he'lllos

rned off in an airport terminalat11 :51P.M 20minutesbeforeadirect flighttoNewYorkwhere you'll be wai

 of the plane.Uh, excuse me!You're not allowed...Looks like the game's still going.Torrent downloade
d from RARBG it's impressive how you get these drugs in the country just by bribing small-time airpo
rt officials.I'm guessing you got about five million bucks worth of fentanyl in here.So what?You and
 your brother here are gonna lecture me?We were actually debating on whetherI should give you the 10
0k or not.He says it's blood money.I agree.I don't have it.Grab his guys, bring 'em to the back and 
shoot 'em.I don't think you want to add murder to your arrest warrant.Wait.Arrest warrant?That guy o
ut there is a DEA informant.We have him in our pocket.He owes us.They're gonna rain down on you and 
your pills.Unless you forgive my brother's debt.Then our informant won't make the call.Have your bro
ther fighting your battles, do you?No.Why don't you tell your guys to drop the guns, and you and I c
an have it out?What do you say, Luca?Scare that guy off.Bring these guys to the back.They make a mov
e, he makes a call.Yeah?I warned you.We got company.Michael:Let's go.All they had to see were DEA ha
ts and suvs, and they were gone.Famous Michael Scofield.Sheba.You have no idea how happy i am to see
 you back home.We're not home yet.All right, so what's next?How do we get this son of a bitch?Wedon'
tdo anything.Your part is over.No, no, no, no, no, no.Tricking abruzzi's kid is one thing.Poseidon--
