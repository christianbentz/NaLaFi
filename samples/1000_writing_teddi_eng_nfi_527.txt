When you fly above New York at night it's like you're looking down at millions of stars.And each star could be the life of a person who calls this great city home.My dad told me that people have always looked at the patterns of the stars to predict what was going to happen in their lives, and if you could understand those patterns, you'd be able to know what was gonna happenbefore anyone else did.The last time we saw each other he told me that each star's light has taken decades to reach us and how it always burns brightest right before it dies.So now, whenever a distant star lights up,I always feel like somewhere, somehow, someone's life is about to end.The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.I've missed you.Stop it right there!Ever had a dream that felt real?So real, you thought you were awake.Tonight, new yorkers have the opportunity to see a highly unusual event above our city.Ashley gains reports.For the next two weeks, we will be able to witness a star going Nova.The di
