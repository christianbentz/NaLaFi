Previously on Shadowhunters...What did I do?- Clary, I am so sorry.Can you raise my mother from the dead?I'll bring your mother back, and, as payment, you can owe me a favor.- The deal's off.If ever demons overtook the world...As a last resort, the Soul-Sword would destroy demon-blooded creatures in its path.- Demon-blooded creatures.We have to free the angel.He can activate the Soul-Sword.I've seen the havoc yin fen can wreak.Do you know where to look for the source?Probably one of the Night Children.Yin fen is made from vampire venom.There's just something I need.What do you need, Shadowhunter?Look, I'm not here to hurt anyone.I just need a little...Someone's been a naughty girl.All out of yin fen?That's okay.I'm just gonna need a lot of blood.You're quick, but not quick enough.Forget the venom.Too late, pretty thing.Release the Shadowhunter.On my orders.I thought you hated me.Call it an intense dislike.So why are you helping me?I don't know.The pain...What did you think yin fen woul
d do to you?I need something...Something to stop it.What you need to do is sweat it out.Okay, over time, you'll be better off.- You need to be strong.You have to.I swear, I'll never ask again.Just this once.Forgive me.How could you not tell me that?The Downworld would be in total chaos if they knew what the Sword could do.There would be uprisings everywhere.So you're saving the Downworlders from themselves?We never asked.We didn't even know that Valentine could activate the Sword until we realized he had an angel.Luke, I didn't want you to worry.Well, it's too late for that.Look, you don't understand, all right...No.He has my sister.What else aren't you two telling me?The angel, he...Just now, on the rooftop, he showed us both a vision of a demon that can destroy the Sword.How do you know that's what he was telling you?There's no other explanation.When the demon touched the Sword, he and the Sword both disintegrated.Luke, it was a demon I'd never seen before.Then go find it.I'll head o
ut and see if that bastard left any clues for us to track him down.There.It could have been a shooting star.Are you saying you don't believe Jace and Clary?I thought you'd be impressed.I'm not saying I don't believe them.It's just that no one's seen an angel in hundreds of years.So...Did you take my advice about Magnus?You did, didn't you?Okay, start talking.There's nothing to talk about.Hey, you guys.Hey, buddy.Max!You look so handsome.What are you doing here?Alec.It's good to see you both.- Izzy...'Cause the last time you were here, you turned your back on all of us.Especially Jace.I was following orders.I had no choice.Max has some big news.Tell them, sweetheart.I passed my last trial.Congratulations.So you finally perfected your roundhouse kick?Yeah, and I knocked out two different instructors.Sadly, your father won't be able to attend.So, Alec, as the eldest male in the family, you will be in charge of Max's ceremonial party.What do you mean he won't be here?He's tied up with the 
Valentine task force in Idris.I can't believe Dad would miss this.He doesn't have a choice.We're all on high alert, especially after what that demon did to both of you and Jocelyn.I was surprised not to see you at the Rite of Mourning.Dad called to see how we were.Isabelle...Bet you wish you were back in Idris.I thought I was coming here to get away from the fighting.Fighting?All the time.What's going on?Mom doesn't like you having a warlock boyfriend.And you?Whatever, I don't care.My mother's back.Which means I'll make myself scarce.No, I have something else in mind.Hmm.How would you feel about throwing a party?Have you met me?It is for Max's Rune Ceremony.I think I'll pass.Magnus...I'm sure I'll love Max.But Maryse?That's sort of the point of the party.So that she can see that this, us, it's not going away.You sure about this?Why wouldn't I be?Then I better get to work.Mr. Morgenstern.What can I help you with?A potion?In a way that makes my skin crawl.I thought we would understand ea
ch other.Both scientists in our own right.I applaud your spirit, but it won't help you.I hear you've met my daughter, Clarissa?- I had no idea...Don't.Please, don't hurt her.I will do anything you ask.Yes.This isn't crazy.You drank blood.You...You've bit a rat.You fought a cobra.You can...It's Clary.That would be something.- Simon, are you okay?I'm very okay.Hopefully.Do you wanna sit?Okay.I get this weird text to meet you here at, like, 11:00 at night?Did something happen with you and Maia?Yes.Um...Look, Clary...The thing is, um...Simon, I don't have a telepathy rune.Right.Okay.We've been friends...Best friends for a long time.A really long time.And the last thing I'd ever want to do is screw that up.Because it's...It's really important to me, too.But...People like you and me...Sometimes feelings evolve, you know?And the relationship, friendship, whatever it is, needs to change along with it...Look, Simon, I...I don't want you to think that we can't still be best friends because you..
.Because you're seeing someone.No, see, that's...I don't...Anyone...I'm in love with you, Clary.But I realized that you might not feel the same way.And it might get weird...We did that.- We did.We did.Was it...Weird?Yeah.In the best way possible._At the residence of Magnus Bane?It's very kind of your friend to offer, but the Rune Ceremony is a solemn rite of passage.For Shadowhunters.Not some Downworlder rave.Where does it say anything about a rave?- And why is it only for Shadowhunters?Traditions change, especially those based on ignorance.Anyone who cares about Max should be there.Together.- If Dad were here he'd understand...Alec...This dinner, it should be about family.What family?- You wanted Jace dead.You keep saying that.After a while, it loses its meaning.You're right.Of course we'll be there.Thank you for going to all this trouble for us.Thank Magnus.Magnus!Aw!You're new, aren't you?I spoil them.It's the only way to win them over.Well, I guess when you put your mind to it, you
 can win over just about anyone, huh?You're talking about Alec.Look, I've been there.I know it's a whirlwind fling that burns so hot all it can do is flame out.Is this what you think it is?I don't know what it is, but I know my brother.And now that you guys have taken things to the next level...- He told you.No.It's...I can just...Look, I'll make this simple, okay?I'm never gonna let anyone hurt him.Then we have that in common.You think I'd invite Maryse Lightwood to my home for just anyone?I hope this party has an open bar.Is there something on my face, or...No, no, um...You're great.Am I being too, uh...Not at all.So do you think anyone's going to notice that we're...Only one way to find out.- Okay, let's go.Can I get a beer.I thought I smelled cocky.Magnus must be really scraping the bottom of the bartender barrel.Aw, you still bitter about getting your ass kicked by a werewolf?In case you forgot, that was a three-against-one fight.Well, I'm actually happy I didn't maul you to death
.Why?No.Because now I know you didn't kill Gretel.I asked for a beer.Beer's boring.Apparently Magnus has a thing for Spain.That is a lot of Shadowhunters.Yeah, it's a Shadowhunter party.Didn't think he had it in him.Guess your date didn't go so well.No, it went great.I, uh, told him to make a move, and that's exactly what he did.- Hey.Hey.Well, you two look cute together.Thanks.We were just heading to the bar to see what kinds of blood-types Magnus has on tap.Do you want anything?I'm good.Okay.Well, I guess congratulations are in order.I guess so.I'm happy for you.Thank you.Maia, um, I just wanted to say thank you for being so cool about, you know everything.Yeah, just don't screw it up by talking too much.Uh, looks like it's about time for my break.Is everything okay?I'll be right back.I'm worried the empanadillas are soggy.- I gave the chef specific directions...Everything is perfect.Max!Mother.I heard you like to drink.Welcome, Maryse.Max, this is your night.You do have exotic taste
, don't you?Oh, the Spanish theme is in honor of you and your husband.Really?Alec told me that Robert proposed to you in Barcelona.I wanted to celebrate a joyous memory.Especially since he couldn't be here.How sweet that Alec feels comfortable sharing our personal family stories with you.Especially considering your...How about a drink?Sangria for the lady, a Roy Rogers for the guest of honor.Clary!- Clary!- No...Look, she kissed me.That's it?Look...What you said about not wanting to risk the friendship...Maybe this is a mistake.So you make out with Maia?No, we weren't...We were just, I don't know, having a moment.I cannot believe this is happening.Look...Clary, no matter how close we are, you will never understand what it's like to live like this.But she does.She gets it.Then why did you even...Hey!It's Simon.He poured his heart out about wanting to be with me, and then...He hooks up with Maia.That doesn't sound like Simon.Are you sure you haven't had too much sangria?- I made sure of 
it.Hey, don't.We'll figure out what's going on with Simon.But tonight's about Max.And Alec and Izzy.You'll never forgive yourself if you're not there for your friends.Okay.Sorry.Venom withdrawal.Saps the nerve endings.Oh, I'm totally fine.Why did you call me here?Your bite...Vampire venom is more powerful than yin fen.It also wears off quicker.That's why it was a one-time deal.Thought I made that clear to you.I know.I wouldn't have asked you to come back if it wasn't an emergency.My mom's in town.I can't let her see me like this.That's the best excuse you can come up with?It's not an excuse.Excuses, justifications, call it what you want.Trust me when I tell you, Isabelle, sweat it out while you still can.- You don't understand.You can get through this.You're one of the strongest Shadowhunters I know.No, I'm not.Everyone thinks I am, but I'm not.Just a drop.Please.Shadowhunter blood is more potent than human blood.Okay.Sure you can.Please.I don't see anything.That's because you're not l
