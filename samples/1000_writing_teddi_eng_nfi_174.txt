Coulson:S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face.Keep the title, but when it comes to operations,I'm calling the shots.Radcliffe:Aida 2.0:And all the answers it holds.We could just reboot the head ... in a controlled environment ... and then we could diagnose the problem together.Please!I'm gonna figure out what broke you.Electronic voice Thank you, Fitz.Will there be another opportunity to acquire the Darkhold?Agent May's decoy will be more convincing.Her programming operates on a subconscious level.If Agent May isn't aware of her mission to retrieve the Darkhold, then she won't be able to reveal herself.She'll instinctively climb the ranks, gain access, and get closer to Agent Coulson, the man who knows just where this book is.Exhales sharply4x11_Coulson:We're gonna miss you in the field.I'll catch up.When this is over, it's time.You don't have to twist my arm.I wouldn't dare.Agent May.Director Mace ... he ... he knows that Aida is... what Aida is?- Yeah.Sighs deeplyH-How did he take it?He wa

That's not a happy word.- Did ...I don't like those words, either.I hear you're on your way to personally escort Aida.Well, no one knows what she can do.- And she saw the Darkhold.Once I've studied it, I-I'd be able to determine ...No.When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.Because it's dangerous, yeah.You still need access to my apartment.- Maybe I could, uh ...Chuckles Right, right, right.Well, I'll reach out to Aida, anyway, tell her to expect you.Be ready to help solve the current... problem.- Sure.Music BeepsAida, I want you to access your information cache.Locate the Sunset Protocol.I have it, Doctor.Activate it.Cellphone beepsDoorbell rings, door opensAida 2.0:Dr. Radcliffe gave me specific instructions.Happy to help.Allow me to retrieve the neural-assessment gauge.What's a neural-assessment gauge?Ohh.Exhales sharplyMusic- I apologize, Agent May.MusicDevice beeps, whirsComputer beepingLet's get you up to speed, shall w

 in S.H.I.E.L.D. knows she's been replaced.- What empirical difference is there?We need May alive for calibration ...- Yes, but I ...Nathanson was a drastic overadjustment.But isn't it preferable to sacrifice one life to save millions?Yes, as a last resort, Aida.Our May Life Model Decoy should get us the Darkhold eventually.And if something goes wrong... then we have our safety net.You're referring to the other android- now in operation.MusicCoulson:Talbot:- Everything has to be aboveboard.Senator Nadeer will be there.We're all aware of the dangers, some of us more than others.I'm fine with it, Jemma.Are you?And, Coulson, you're letting her.With Nadeer and her staff in the meeting,- we have an opportunity.I wasn't briefed on any opportunity.While Nadeer's in with Daisy,Yo-Yo and I will get into her office and plant surveillance.Daisy:- figure out her next move.No, there'll be no planting, no eyeing, no Yo-Yo-ing.S.H.I.E.L.D. is now legitimate.You mean like juicing our Director so he ca
n pretend to be Inhuman?Look, you are reacting to the situation we had.You put Jeffrey in place, I understand, but we're S.H.I.E.L.D. We have to be proactive.This is politics, Phil, which means politicians.They are a festering cesspool of toxic-waste fires.You swim in those waters, you could get pulled under.You and the Director can handle it.We'll handle the rest.Always.Monitors beepingHmm.As I said, no reason to even consider harming Agent May.Very good, Doctor.Glass shattersOh, dear.MusicGlass scratchingBreathes deeplyChucklesI'm happy Turtleman came out to play this morning.You.- It's not a nickname for your ...- We could find a nickname for it......but ... okay.

ppening.Door closesGentlemen, Agent Mackenzie requested personal time, so he's not with us on this.Mack or no Mack, I'm urging you to reconsider the second part of this mission.Which part is the second part again?- The stupid part.If she discovers you've launched an unauthorized investigation into her, it's gonna trigger an investigation into you.There are always consequences.It's dangerous, but she is dangerous.And this is our chance to get ahead of it proactively.- Gentlemen, I'm sure we ...Half the time, I'm reacting to the steaming pile of fart-pebbles you hand me.And the other half, you're not giving me the full story.- We're like the odd couple here.At the very least, we need a contingency plan.If she comes after you, she's gonna wantS.H.I.E.L.D. records, S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.Let me take them to a military facility for protection.That makes no sense.Our people are trained to protect those assets.Until she deposes all of you.General, the assets belong here.Nadeer tried to kill seve

ple, so...He believed in me before I believed in myself.You too, you know.It's why he wants you with us still.He keeps saying you were trying to do the right thing.- Oh, you've talked about it, huh?And listen, with me... sometimes it's...Sometimes I think it's an act.You got this.- Jeffrey, I'm surprised to see you.Surprised to see him not dead, you mean?There'll be plenty of time to ask questions after we've started, Ellen.I expect a lot of questions will be answered in this meeting.Have fun.Great.I think we're gonna find out.Man:Agent Daisy Johnson, we'd like to swear you in.Camera shutters clicking- Beeps You're clear, go in.Beeps- That went well.So, Mack ... personal time, huh?Don't put me in the middle of this.What middle?It's not for me to say.All I know about him is what's in his file.I spent six months on a plane with the guy.I bet I know less than you.So maybe something's on his file.Maybe you should ask him.Speaking SpanishWell, I don't know about annoying him, but you're sta
rting to annoy me.Isn't it better to learn things organically instead of all at once in a report?No, all at once.Private person, secrets?Must be even tougher with May.If it's better to get to know each other- in tiny, slow, annoying pieces......then you two will never get together.Me and May?- No.I don't need to read a file on you two to know.You know, no one likes a smart-ass.That hasn't been my experience._Door opens- You and May ready for the op?Uh, we could always use a fresh pair of eyes if you'd like to join us.Yeah, no.Okay.You know, one of the upsides of having a girlfriend is you get to talk about what's bothering you.Yeah, well, doesn't really sound like an upside for the girlfriend.I know you're upset about Aida.I don't want to intrude on you while you're... processing.But I also want you to know you can talk to me.- Always.Just, uh...You know I go all quiet when I'm... processing.Okay.Door closesBreathing heavily MusicDaisy:Being a party to the Sokovia Accords would be very
