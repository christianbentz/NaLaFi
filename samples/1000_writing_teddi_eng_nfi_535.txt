- Nothing's right since Steve left.- Who wrote these?Did Cal write the last three rungs?He just filed an application for tax-exempt status with the IRS.If that goes through, he'll be hard to stop.- I'll contact our friends over at Internal Revenue.You're a sharp guy.It's a shame you let the Bureau keep you in the basement for so long.- Yes, it is.- Our tax-exempt status was denied.The money situation is critical.Fix it with the IRS.Get our exemption.Get me the money to do what I need to do to live with everything that you've done.- Lisa, I wanted to talk to you about the exemption.Meyerism helped you at a very difficult time in your life.Now the movement needs something from you.- I can't see you anymore, Dad.- You can't see me anymore?- Eddie, what are you doing here?- I will fucking murder you before I let you take him from me.- Eddie, what are you doing?- They are following me.The Meyerists, the Meyerists.Now leave me the fuck alone.- Eddie!It was late, 1:00 a.m, 2:00 a.m.I don't re
member.Ugh, I was in so much pain.The divorce.I was so angry.Like, I couldn't breathe, and just out of my mind.And I was taking these pills that my doctor prescribed, but I shouldn't have been, not with the amount I was drinking.Tell me what happened, Lisa.I didn't mean to.Oh, my God.What have I done?It's not easy to hear.She's in such pain.- She was, but thanks to the process of unburdening, we were able to assess her damage and create a map for her spiritual development and healing.When Lisa came to us, she was paralyzed by guilt.We gave her her life back.She wouldn't be working at the IRS or anywhere else if it weren't for us.- But what if we're wrong about our exemption application being her call?- She's still closer to whosever call it is than we are.I mean, all I'm suggesting is that we remind her what The Movement did for her and what it could do for others.- You were against the religious status.- We don't have any money, Cal.I told the people of Clarksville that I would test t
heir water, and now I need the funds to do it.I need this.It's my Offset.It has become my hope that this will set me free, because I'm haunted, Cal.So, please, set the meeting.- Okay.- Hey.Hey, slow down.It's okay, you're in a hospital.You're safe.I'm Dr. Hollins.You can call me Sally.Can you tell me your name?Eddie.Eddie Lane.- Do you know why you're here?- I flipped out at the hotel.I hit someone.Look, I'm...- No, no need to be sorry here.Do you know why you flipped out?- Look, I just had a rough day with my, um... my son.And then there was this guy.He was following me.And then I guess I drank too much.Look.- Oh, of course, of course.A guy was following you?- Um... no.No, no, I mean, it just seemed like he was.Look, I've just been... under a lot of stress lately.- The person who brought you in...- Uh, Chloe.- Said you spent the last two decades in a cult.- It wasn't really a...Just the Meyerist Movement.It's more of a...- I understand reintegration into mainstream society is hard.Per
haps we can help you with that.Are you on any psychiatric medications?- No.- Any history of mental illness in your family?- No.- Your brother?My brother, um...Look, he was...He was depressed.And he committed...Look, he took his own life.But that was a long time ago.- Did the Meyerist Movement do that to you?Mr. Lane?I was so afraid.He just appeared out of nowhere.I didn't know what he was gonna do.- Cal Roberts?Did he explicitly threaten you?- But now he's asked me to come to the compound to meet with them.- Them?- I don't know.That's what he said, to come to the compound to sit down with "them."He didn't say who "them" was, exactly.I'm terrified.They helped me at a very hard time in my life, so I've always worn the Eye, supported The Movement.Once in a while, I take a workshop.But I don't want anything to do with them anymore.- I understand, Ms. Jackson.Give me a minute.They're gonna try to threaten a federal official.- Well, Cal Roberts is freaking out from the financial pressure.- I
f we can get it on tape...- That's risky.- Spoke with U.S.A. Penetti this morning.He wants this guy shut down.Part of his mandate to end organized crime.- Well, they're not exactly the mafia.- Gangsters on Yoga mats.Listen.I'm concerned that Cal is gonna run circles around this woman.- How you feeling, Agent Gaines?- I'm solid.- We've been investigating the Meyerist Movement.Regardless of how they may have helped you in the past, you understand they're threatening you to get what they want, and that's illegal, and a god-awful way to treat someone that's come to you for help.And it's probably not just you.What I'd like you to do, Lisa, is to go in that meeting.We'll be listening.This may not look like much, but... it's a modern listening device.You could be a great asset to us.But I want to be crystal clear;If you want to help us,I need you to say out loud that you're willing to do so.- I'll help you.- He wouldn't forget.- I don't know where he is, hon.He's not picking up his phone.You 
know, maybe something came up.- I want to wait.- I don't know, honey.Hello?- Is this Eddie Lane's phone?You must be Sarah.Sleepwalkers.Steve used to call them pawns on a Monopoly board.Pass Go, buy, pay, buy, pay.Once in a while, you'd land in jail.Powerless and afraid.That's the human experience, right?And... and sometimes wildly happy too.Life can be fun, a party.But it's the same loop, over and over, and endless loop to the grave, because that's what it is out there in the I.S. world.We are taught to be helpless and powerless.Helpless and powerless.With little pockets of fun so we don't do ourselves in.But you, all of you in this room, have chosen something different.You have chosen not to be among the sleepwalkers.- Right.- You're here because you want to say,"This is my life."You want to be awake.You don't want the fog.You want to roll the dice.And if you roll threes, you want to move 12, right?Yeah, you want control and clarity.You want to be the master of your fate.And you can d
o it, because you have that much power inside of you.You have The Light to use, to focus, to shape the world around you.With it, anything is possible.And here's the best part.You already know how to do it.Mary.What color is the wall?- White.- What color do you want it to be?You can make it any color you want.It's your wall, Mary.The wall is right here, Mary, not over there.If you don't focus on what you want, you can't get it, because there is nothing in this world that you cannot change if you bring your full force of will against it.- Red.- So make it so.Change it.Turn the wall red, Mary.Just turn it red.- It's red.- Hmm?Hmm?- It's green.- Green, that's great.That's great.Hawk made it green.What about you, Noa?- Yellow.- Yellow, I love it!Your wall, your life.- As blue as the sky.As blue as the sky.- Whoo!- Hey, what's up, Sean?Come on, don't miss out.What color, Sean?Come on, Sean.- Take control of your life.- You can do it.- You got this.- You can do it, man.You can do it, Sean.- R
ed.It's red.- Where you going?- It's New York.Something's out there.You headed home?Gonna spend the rest of your night reading The Ladder in your room?- No.- Be easy, Hawk.- Can I come with you?- Taking control of your life, huh?- Trying.- That smell.You can't understand how wonderful it is.- I do.It's summer to me.Has been my whole life.- But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.Someplace so cold and forbidding, so utterly devoid of life, you can't know how precious it is, how vulnerable.Rabbits.Shame.- If we're gonna discuss Cal, should we go somewhere more private?- I don't think we're the ones who should be hiding.- Cal could have written the rungs, but I struggle to believe he's capable of harming Steve.The man was a father to him.- We could live a thousand lives and still never find bottom in the sea of human cruelty.- You make pronouncements like that.You always have.But there's a human side to this which you haven't been around to see.Accusations like this
 could ruin The Movement.- The Movement was never my thing.That's why I cut out.But I owe my life to Steve and his work, and I will find who hurt him.- I'm aware of that.But Steve cared about The Movement above anything, so we need to tread carefully.We need proof before we do a thing.- Eddie.Hi.I'm Chloe.All right.I'm gonna go get a coffee.You want anything?I'll be right back.- Eddie, what happened to your face?- What, you didn't get the report?- What report?- From the person you sent to intimidate me.- What?- Some guy followed me after I came to the center.Oh.I freaked out.- I don't know anything about anyone following you.- Sure you do.It's what you guys do over there, isn't it?I mean, I did it.- I promise you, I did not have anyone follow you, Eddie.How long are they keeping you here?- Till they think I'm fit to leave, I guess.- What are they doing for you?- Just tests, meds, I don't know yet.- They don't know what's wrong with you.- Sarah.They don't know how to help you.- Hey.- Sh
e doesn't know how to help you.- Come back.- Sarah...- Come back home.Please.- Hey.Hey.- It's a great workshop.- Oh, thanks.Yeah.I remember when Steve revealed it.- Mm-hmm?- My dad had just run a number on me.We had a complicated relationship.- Yeah.- Anyway, I was feeling so low, and Steve, he took me into this little room, and he showed me how to paint flowers on my walls of doom.- I wish I learned how to do that when I was a kid.- You're doing it now.- Yeah.Yeah.Listen, I got to go catch a bus.- Yeah, yeah, have a great evening, huh?- You too.Oh, hey, hey.Let me get that.- You the new owner?- Cal Roberts.- True you're expanding your homeless shelter here?- Yeah, partially.That, along with some other ways we plan to serve the borough and the community.- Right on.When can I move in?'Cause I'm homeless now.Oh, I'm not the right kind of homeless.- No, you're always welcome.- Yeah, right, welcome while I'm being thrown out of my home, place I've lived at for the last ten years.You and th
