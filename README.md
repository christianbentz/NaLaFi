# NaLaFi
This repo contains data and code to work on Natural Language Fingerprints (NaLaFi), and to replicate the results in Bentz (2023). The code should be run in the following order:

- sampler.Rmd: samples chunks of UTF-8 characters of pre-defined length (e.g. 10, 100, 1000) and stores them in NaLaFi/samples. Note that this folder should be emptied before re-running the code.
