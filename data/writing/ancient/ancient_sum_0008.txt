#comments:	Comments were removed. List of transliteration conventions: https://cdli.ucla.edu/methods/ednotes.html. In the original transliteration a number followed by parentheses with a sign name inside, e.g. 2(disz), means that this sign occurs the given number of times. This is here then rendered as "disz disz".
