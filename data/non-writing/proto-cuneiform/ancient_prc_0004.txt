#comments:	Cuneiform on a clay tablet of the late Uruk period (ca. 3200-3000 BC). A full sign list can be found on the above-mentioned link. List of transliteration conventions: https://cdli.ucla.edu/methods/ednotes.html. Note that in the original transliteration, repetitive signs are given with multiplier numbers, e.g. 5(X) means that the sign with code X is repeated five times on the tablet. We here render this as <X X X X X>.
