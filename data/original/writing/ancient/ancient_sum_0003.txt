#comments:	Cuneiform of the Ur III (ca. 2100-2000 BC). A full sign list can be found on the above-mentioned link. Lines beginning with '#' are comments. List of transliteration conventions: https://cdli.ucla.edu/methods/ednotes.html. In the original transliteration a number followed by parentheses with a sign name inside, e.g. 2(disz), means that this sign occurs the given number of times. This is here then rendered as "disz disz".
